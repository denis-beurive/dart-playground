// This script illustrates the use of stream controllers.
//
// A stream controller provides a stream. The controller user can interact with
// the stream through the stream controller API. In particular, it is possible
// to inject events into the stream, through the controller API. It is interesting
// to point out that more than one entity can inject data into the stream provided
// by the controller.
//
// See: https://webdev.dartlang.org/articles/performance/event-loop

/// This class encapsulates all the necessary data used by the "onValue" event
/// handler (the construct avoids using global variables).

    _streamSubscription = stream;
  }

  // This static method is the handler executed when a event is received through
  // the stream.
  //
  // WARNING: you have absolutely no idea when this handler will be executed.
  // Do not assume that it will be executed right after the execution of the code
  // that emits an event. It may be executed several lines (of codes) below the
  // line that emits the event. It may well be executed after the end of the
  // script.
  static void onValue(int value) {
    // At this point: the state of the subscription is (inevitably) "active".
    print("onValue: An event has been raised. The associated value is ${value}!");

    // Note 1: once a Dart function starts executing, it continues executing until
    //         it exits. When managing interrupts in C, it is necessary to protect
    //         interrupt handlers from being interrupted. This is not the case in
    //         Dart : a function (and, thus, an event handler) cannot be interrupted
    //         by the occurrence of another event.
    //         => The code below has no sense, other than experimentation.
    // Note 2: while paused, the subscription will not fire any events. If it receives
    //         events from its source, they will be buffered until the subscription
    //         is resumed.

  // Create a controller.

      // - Dart is single-threaded.
      // - An event handler cannot be interrupted: once a Dart function starts
      //   executing, it continues executing until it exits. In other words, Dart
      //   functions canâ€™t be interrupted by other Dart code.
      //   See https://webdev.dartlang.org/articles/performance/event-loop
