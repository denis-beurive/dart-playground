# Streams

Basically, a stream can be seen as a FIFO that propagates _values_ from a _publisher_
to at least one _subscriber_.

By subscribing to a stream, a _subscriber_ gets notified whenever a value is available
in the stream. In other words, it gets notified "in the event" of a value being available.
Yet another way to say it is: a _subscriber_ "listens" to _events_ (which are notifications of
availability). This explains why _subscribers_ may also be called _(event) listeners_.

> For those who work with brokers (such as RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ...), the term "subscriber" may be the one that springs to mind first.
> For those who come from the JavaScript world, it would be the term "event listener", or "event handle".

The association between a _subscriber_ and a _stream_ is called a _subscription_.
A _subscription_ can be:

* **cancelled**: once the _subscription_ is cancelled, the _subscriber_ does not receive any more notification.
  Please note that the cancellation is irreversible. Once the subscription is cancelled,
  the stream is (asynchronously) destroyed.
* **paused**: Once the subscription is paused, the subscriber does not receive any more notification until the subscription
  is resumed. Please note that a pause is reversible (by contrast with the cancellation).
  While the subscription is paused, events are stored.
* **resumed**: a previously paused subscription may be resumed. When a subscription is resumed, the subscriber gets notified
  of the events again.

Streams can be classified into two groups:

* **unicast streams**: unicast streams propagates events from one publisher to one (and only one) subscriber.
* **broadcast streams**: broadcast streams propagates events from one publisher to one or more subscribers.

# Creating a stream

On way to create a stream is to write a function that "injects" values into the stream.

> To designate the process of "feeding" the stream with values, Dart does not use the verb "to inject", it uses the verb "to yield".
> In French, "yield" translates into "c√©der". This translation may be interesting for French readers.

Please note that values are "yielded" as they become available.
This means that the function that implements the publisher cannot return a result immediately.
Thus, this function must execute asynchronously.

Example:

    import 'dart:async';

    typedef Streamer = Stream<int> Function();

    main() async {

        /// Return a stream of integers.
        Streamer streamCreator = () async* {
            for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
                yield 3*i;
                sleep(Duration(seconds: 1));
            }
        };

        Stream<int> stream = streamCreator();
    }

> Please note the use of the keywords `async*` and `yield`.

# Subscribing to a stream

    StreamSubscription<int> subscription = streamCreator().listen(
        (int value) => print("A value is available: ${value}.")
    );

In this example we set a (event) handler, implemented by an anonymous function, that will be fired up whenever a value
is available in the stream.

> Please note that as soon this code is executed, the script continues its execution. The instructions that follow may well
> be (and will be) executed before the handler gets executed.

Please note that there are other ways to subscribe to a stream.

# Waiting for a value to be available

Sometimes it is necessary to block the execution of the script until a value gets available.

    await for(int value in streamCreator()) {
        (value) => print("A value is available: ${value}.")
    }
    print("Done");

The last instruction (`print("Done")`) will not be executed until the stream dries up.

Another way to wait for a stream to dry up:

    await streamCreator().forEach(
        (int value) => print("A value is available: ${value}.")
    ).then((var v) { print("Done"); });

And yet another way:

    StreamSubscription<int> subscription = streamCreator().listen(
        (int value) => print("A value is available: ${value}.")
    );
    await Future.wait([subscription.asFuture<int>()]).then((List<int> value) {
        print("Done");
    });
