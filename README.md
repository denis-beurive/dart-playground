This project contains test scripts written during my study of the Dart programming language.

Make sure to run the command below:

    pub get

> See: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get

In order to enable assertions, you must explicitly configure Dart from the command line.
For example:

    dart --enable-asserts bin/isolates.dart

> See: https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour#assert
